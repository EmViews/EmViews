# EmViews
April 2017
Emviews is a Yelp for products – aside from being short on cash, what’s a big issue one encounters when buying a product…??? Having 5-10+ Chrome tabs open just to research the product! EmViews solves that problem by aggregating reviews for said product onto one page. A search for any product reveals Amazon price/rating, Reddit reviews, and YouTube videos (eventually more)!
